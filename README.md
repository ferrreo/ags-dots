You need ags v1 (either from v1 branch or main once it is released)

You also need: cava, playerctl, curl, hyprland


Just stick the .config folder in your home then edit ~/.config/ags/widgets/weather.js to change the city to your city.


The programs folder in the config comes with pre-compiled binaries, these have all been compiled with PGO optimisations as well being compacted.

The source for all of these is available in the src folder if you want to compile them yourself or make changes.


CSS is borrowed and modified from [end-4](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) - Visual design of the bar is also based off their hybrid bar.
